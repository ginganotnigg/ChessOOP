## About the Project
NoobChess is a Windows-based chess game developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The game features an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed with the SFML library, offering optimized gameplay with interactive features such as undoing moves and real-time game instructions. The game also includes full chess logic with win, lose, draw conditions, and supports complex interactions like check and capture mechanics.

## Key Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements chessboard and piece classes using OOP principles for clear code structure and modularity.
- **SFML Interface**: A smooth and interactive graphical interface utilizing the SFML library, making it easy to learn and play.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- **Undo Feature**: Players can undo their previous move, but at the cost of reduced gameplay time.
- **Piece Movement & Control**: Full control over the pieces with check and capture interactions.
- **Win/Lose/Draw Conditions**: The game ends with proper win/lose/draw conditions based on standard chess rules.
- **In-Game Instructions**: Accessible instructions ensure that even beginner players can pick up the game easily.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for game logic and OOP design.
- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library used for rendering the chessboard and handling user inputs.
